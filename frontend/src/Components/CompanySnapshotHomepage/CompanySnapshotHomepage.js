        never wanted to be the biggest. just the best.
        erp...can't live with it, can't live without it.
        faceless, unaccountable corporations.
        most people dread talking about a new erp system. change is difficult. 



        one thing is absolutely clear. you never get what you need from your erp. 
        and if you do, it often costs an arm and a leg, months of foregone revenue, and a "fix" that only 


        The solution is not a large, faceless competitor. And it certainly is not throwing more money at them. 

        Most manufacturing executives know of revenue opportunities that they simply cannot target 
        because of internal operational bottlenecks. 
        Our Enterprise Resource Planning solutions will give your company what it needs, when it needs it, 
        and provide invaluable insight from decades of experience with solving identical or adjacent problems. 
        
        You want to make and sell more stuff.
        and
        Your greatest financial return will not be actualized attempting to patch together an ERP solution.

    NEW FROM MIKE

    Fidelis has always maintained the same goal: Not to be the biggest, but to
    be the best. While prioritizing the latter, the most significant challenge we&#39;ve
    faced is meeting the immense demand for our solutions.
    Your manufacturing goals are simple: You want to make and sell more stuff
    and be as profitable as possible doing so. Many manufacturers know of new
    opportunities that they simply cannot capitalize on because of internal
    operational bottlenecks. A nimble, comprehensive, data-oriented ERP system
    can be a key part of changing this. Your greatest financial return will not be
    actualized throwing more capital at the same generic, large system expecting
    different results.
    Manufacturing leaders are often forced early on to accept the lie that you will
    never get what you need from your ERP system. And if you do, it will cost an
    arm and a leg, months of foregone revenue, and a &quot;fix&quot; that, if they&#39;re lucky,
    might last a few months.
    The solution is not an unaccountable, faceless corporation providing your
    ERP system, who will likely continue to increase your annual licensing as you
    become more dependent upon them. And it certainly is not throwing more
    money at them when your problems aren&#39;t being solved.
    Our Enterprise Resource Planning solutions will give your company what it
    needs, when it needs it, and provide invaluable insight from decades of
    experience of solving identical or adjacent problems. But don&#39;t take our word
    for it. Ask our clients why they love our products; our 100% client retention
    rate says it all.
    Your business needs a launchpad. Your business needs Fidelis.
