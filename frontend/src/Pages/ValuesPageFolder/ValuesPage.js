        Message from the President
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Thank you for taking a moment to visit Fidelis,
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        I started Fidelis in 2002 because I saw the market need for results-based ERP, data, and consulting services for mid-sized manufacturers. Since its founding, Fidelis has strived to address this need and has grown steadily as a result. We do this by concentrating on certain principles:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Become intimate with a client’s business:</strong> An esteemed mentor once taught me that a good technology partner learns a client’s business nearly as well as the client itself. We insist that our consultants listen intently to and document clients’ system needs, quickly understand applicability to the business, and apply their technical expertise to develop and build meaningful technology solutions fast.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li><strong>Design and develop sensible solutions:</strong> Based on the client environment, budget, and nature of needs, we develop recommendations and implement software that brings direct value to a client’s business. This includes working closely with the client to integrate the software with internal processes. This approach contrasts with firms who might focus more on selling high-end software or staffing consultants.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li><strong>Serve as a single partner:</strong> Our versatility allows our clients to turn to us for any aspect of software development and implementation, including project management, analysis, design, programming, training, and system conversion.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li><strong>Practice loyalty and gratitude:</strong> When a client entrusts important work to us when there are clearly alternatives, that is never forgotten.  After we deliver the first project for our clients, we continually strive to provide timely service and support and in turn have maintained strong, longstanding business relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Whether we are implementing our SV ERP software, managing a large software or testing initiative, or helping a client formulate a strategic technology vision, we remain true to the above principles.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
          The net result: <em>Every one of our clients will speak to our contribution — <strong>every one</strong>.</em>
        </div>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We look forward to the chance to learn more about your organization’s information needs and determine if we will have the privilege of serving you in some capacity.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Respectfully,
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Mike Sweet
        <br></br>
